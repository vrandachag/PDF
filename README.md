# Some Common Libraries for PDFs in Python
There are many libraries available freely for working with PDFs:

1. PDFMiner: It is an open-source tool for extracting text from PDF. It is used for performing analysis on the data. It can also be used as a PDF transformer or PDF parser.

2. PDFQuery: It is a lightweight python wrapper around PDFMiner, Ixml, and PyQuery. It is a fast, user-friendly PDF scraping library.

3. Tabula.py: It is a python wrapper for tabula.java. It converts PDF files into Pandasâ€™ data frame and further all data manipulation operations can be performed on the data frame.

4. Xpdf: It allows conversion of PDFs into text.

5. pdflib: It is an extension of the poppler library with python bindings present in it.

6. Slate: It is a Python package based on the PDFMiner and used for extraction of text from PDF.

7. PyPDF2: It is a python library used for performing major tasks on PDF files such as extracting the document-specific information, merging the PDF files, splitting the pages of a PDF file, adding watermarks to a file, encrypting and decrypting the PDF files, etc. We will use the PyPDF2 library in this tutorial. It is a pure python library so it can run on any platform without any platform-related dependencies on any external libraries.
